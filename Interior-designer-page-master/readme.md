  <p style="color: green">MOBILE RESPONSIVE</p>

- After Making so many projects using `HTML` & `CSS` this project was a peice of cake although it was easy to make on the `desktop-view` it was a bit tricky on the `mobile-view`. I used a new property called `background-attachment:fixed` to achieve the `background-image` on the Mobile-View.

## Learnings

- I learnt how to set the `background-image` to a static image on scroll by using the `background-attachment:fixed` in the `@media-queries`
- I also used `background-position:left` and `background-size: cover` and `background-repeat: no-repeat` to achieve the same.
- Time Consumed to make this page **2 Hours 50 Minutes**
