  <p style="color: green">MOBILE RESPONSIVE</p>

- To be honest this was the most lengthy assignment. I had ever made using `HTML` & `CSS`. To achieve this I used `flex-box` and set the `flex-direction` to column to achieve Mobile Responsiveness.

## Learnings

- I used `flex-box` to almost make all the elements of this project
- The project was pretty lengthy so I tackled one part at a time
- I also achieved Mobile Responsiveness by using `flex-direction:column` in `@media-queries`
- Time Consumed to make this page **4 Hours 20 Minutes**
